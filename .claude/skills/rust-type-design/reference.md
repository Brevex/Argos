## Public types are Debug (M-PUBLIC-DEBUG) { #M-PUBLIC-DEBUG }

<why>easy debugging without leaking sensitive data.</why>

All public types exposed by a crate should implement `Debug`. Most types can do so via `#[derive(Debug)]`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Endpoint(String);
```

Types designed to hold sensitive data should also implement `Debug`, but do so via a custom implementation.
This implementation must employ unit tests to ensure sensitive data isn't actually leaked, and will not be in the future.

```rust
use std::fmt::{Debug, Formatter};

struct UserSecret(String);

impl Debug for UserSecret {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "UserSecret(...)")
    }
}

#[test]
fn test() {
    let key = "552d3454-d0d5-445d-ab9f-ef2ae3a8896a";
    let secret = UserSecret(key.to_string());
    let rendered = format!("{:?}", secret);

    assert!(rendered.contains("UserSecret"));
    assert!(!rendered.contains(key));
}
```

## Public types meant to be read are Display (M-PUBLIC-DISPLAY) { #M-PUBLIC-DISPLAY }

<why>usability.</why>

If your type is expected to be read by upstream consumers, be it developers or end users, it should implement `Display`. This in particular includes:

- Error types, which are mandated by `std::error::Error` to implement `Display`
- Wrappers around string-like data

Implementations of `Display` should follow Rust customs; this includes rendering newlines and escape sequences.
The handling of sensitive data outlined in [M-PUBLIC-DEBUG] applies analogously.

[M-PUBLIC-DEBUG]: #M-PUBLIC-DEBUG

## Accept `impl AsRef<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-ASREF) { #M-IMPL-ASREF }

<why>flexibility for callers to use their own types.</why>

In **function** signatures, accept `impl AsRef<T>` for types that have a
[clear reference hierarchy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html#implementors), where you
do not need to take ownership, or where object creation is relatively cheap.

| Instead of ... | accept ... |
| --- | --- |
| `&str`, `String` | `impl AsRef<str>` |
| `&Path`, `PathBuf` | `impl AsRef<Path>` |
| `&[u8]`, `Vec<u8>` | `impl AsRef<[u8]>` |

```rust,ignore
# use std::path::Path;
// Definitely use `AsRef`, the function does not need ownership.
fn print(x: impl AsRef<str>) {}
fn read_file(x: impl AsRef<Path>) {}
fn send_network(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}

// Further analysis needed. In these cases the function wants
// ownership of some `String` or `Vec<u8>`. If those are
// "low freqency, low volume" functions `AsRef` has better ergonomics,
// otherwise accepting a `String` or `Vec<u8>` will have better
// performance.
fn new_instance(x: impl AsRef<str>) -> HoldsString {}
fn send_to_other_thread(x: impl AsRef<[u8]>) {}
```

In contrast, **types** should generally not be infected by these bounds:

```rust,ignore
// Generally not ok. There might be exceptions for performance
// reasons, but those should not be user visible.
struct User<T: AsRef<str>> {
    name: T
}

// Better
struct User {
    name: String
}
```

## Accept `impl 'IO'` where feasible ('sans IO') (M-IMPL-IO) { #M-IMPL-IO }

<why>business logic untangled from I/O, with N*M composability.</why>

Functions and types that only need to perform one-shot I/O during initialization should be written "[sans-io](https://www.firezone.dev/blog/sans-io)",
and accept some `impl T`, where `T` is the appropriate I/O trait, effectively outsourcing I/O work to another type:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, caller must provide a File to parse the given data. If this
// data comes from the network, it'd have to be written to disk first.
fn parse_data(file: File) {}
```

```rust
// Much better, accepts
// - Files,
// - TcpStreams,
// - Stdin,
// - &[u8],
// - UnixStreams,
// ... and many more.
fn parse_data(data: impl std::io::Read) {}
```

Synchronous functions should use [`std::io::Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html) and
[`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html). Asynchronous _functions_ targeting more than one runtime should use
[`futures::io::AsyncRead`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/io/trait.AsyncRead.html) and similar.
_Types_ that need to perform runtime-specific, continuous I/O should instead abstract the runtime
behind a private enum that dispatches to the selected one, as shown for mocked I/O in
[M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS](../rust-testing/reference.md#M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS).


## Accept `impl RangeBounds<>` where feasible (M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS) { #M-IMPL-RANGEBOUNDS }

<why>flexibility and clarity when specifying ranges.</why>

Functions that accept a range of numbers must use a `Range` type or trait over hand-rolled parameters:

```rust,ignore
// Bad
fn select_range(low: usize, high: usize) {}
fn select_range(range: (usize, usize)) {}
```

In addition, functions that can work on arbitrary ranges, should accept `impl RangeBounds<T>` rather than `Range<T>`.

```rust
# use std::ops::{RangeBounds, Range};
// Callers must call with `select_range(1..3)`
fn select_range(r: Range<usize>) {}

// Callers may call as
//     select_any(1..3)
//     select_any(1..)
//     select_any(..)
fn select_any(r: impl RangeBounds<usize>) {}
```

## Builders validate in final `.build()` (M-BUILD-RESULT) { #M-BUILD-RESULT }

<why>clean builder error handling.</why>

A builder's per-field setters should accept input without failing, final validation should be done by `.build()`.

Fallible setters add noise, and still don't guard against interdependent error conditions. Where builders are fallible they should offer a `Result`-carrying `.build()` instead.

```rust,ignore
// Bad, forces repeated error checks that provide no value.
Foo::builder()
    .name("Foo")?
    .distance(42)?
    .build();

// Good, consolidates sanity checking and allows for cross-checks 
// between properties.
Foo::builder()
    .name("Foo")
    .distance(42)
    .build()?;
```

That said, individual settings should prefer strong types carrying their own validation where applicable, compare M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD.

## Newtypes guard their invariants (M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD) { #M-STRONG-TYPES-GUARD }

<why>centralized correctness invariants.</why>

When introducing a strong type or newtype that exists to encode an invariant (a non-empty string, a percentage, a port number, a sanitized path, ...), the type itself must enforce that invariant where applicable.

Construction should be fallible, returning a proper error when the invariant cannot be upheld, rather than handing the responsibility off to every user:

```rust,ignore
// Bad, creates a new type but enforces nothing. Every caller now has to
// re-check that the value is actually a valid month, defeating the point of
// having a dedicated type.
pub struct Month(pub u8);

impl Month {
    pub fn new(value: u8) -> Self { ... }
}


// Good, the invariant (1..=12) is checked once, at the boundary, and
// every later use of `Month` can rely on it.
pub struct Month(u8);

impl Month {
    pub fn from_u8(value: u8) -> Result<Self, DateError> { ... }
}
```

This means for any newtype that is non-total:

- It must have at least one fallible constructor (e.g., `fn from_foo(...) -> Result<Self, _>`).
- Additional panicking constructors are allowed (e.g., `new`), and should preferably be `const`.
- Conversions from weaker types into the newtype must be fallible (`TryFrom`/`FromStr`).
- Infallible `From` implementations may not be offered.

> ### <tip></tip> Why `const`?
>
> Const constructors allows them to be used inside `const {}` blocks, which surfaces these violations as errors. This enables
> users to do `let month_due = const { Month::new(14) }` and avoids hitting these paths during runtime.

## Use the proper type family (M-STRONG-TYPES) { #M-STRONG-TYPES }

<why>the right data and safety invariants, at the right time.</why>

Use the appropriate `std` type for your task. In general you should use the strongest type available, as early as possible in your API flow. Common offenders are

| Do not use ... | use instead ... | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `String`* | `PathBuf`* | Anything dealing with the OS should be `Path`-like |

That said, you should also follow common Rust `std` conventions. Purely numeric types at public API boundaries (e.g., `window_size()`) are expected to
be regular numbers, not `Saturating<usize>`, `NonZero<usize>`, or similar.

## Avoid smart pointers and wrappers in APIs (M-AVOID-WRAPPERS) { #M-AVOID-WRAPPERS }

<why>low cognitive load and ergonomic APIs.</why>

As a specialization of [M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS], generic wrappers and smart pointers like
`Rc<T>`, `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>`, or `RefCell<T>` should be avoided in public APIs.

From a user perspective these are mostly implementation details, and introduce infectious complexity that users have to
resolve. In fact, these might even be impossible to resolve once multiple crates disagree about the required type of wrapper.

If wrappers are needed internally, they should be hidden behind a clean API that uses simple types like `&T`, `&mut T`, or `T` directly. Compare:

```rust,ignore
// Good: simple API
pub fn process_data(data: &Data) -> State { ... }
pub fn store_config(config: Config) -> Result<(), Error> { ... }

// Bad: Exposing implementation details
pub fn process_shared(data: Arc<Mutex<Shared>>) -> Box<Processed> { ... }
pub fn initialize(config: Rc<RefCell<Config>>) -> Arc<Server> { ... }
```

Smart pointers in APIs are acceptable when:

- The smart pointer is fundamental to the API's purpose (e.g., a new container lib)

- The smart pointer, based on benchmarks, significantly improves performance and the complexity is justified.

[M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS]: #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS

## Collections implement the appropriate iter traits (M-COLLECTION-TRAITS) { #M-COLLECTION-TRAITS }

<why>composable collections.</why>

Custom collections should implement the iterator-facing traits the standard library offers.

Whenever you define a new collection type `Collection<T>` for consumption by third parties, the following traits and types should also be implemented, [see here](https://cheats.rs/#iterators) for more details:

- the structs `IntoIter<T>`, `Iter<T>` and `IterMut<T>`,
- an `impl Iterator` for all of them,
- the methods `c.iter()` and `c.iter_mut()`,
- an `impl IntoIterator` for `Collection<T>`, `&Collection<T>` and `&mut Collection<T>`,
- an `impl FromIterator` for `Collection<T>`,
- an `Extend` for `Collection<T>`,
- `DoubleEndedIterator`, `ExactSizeIterator`, ... as applicable

In addition, make sure you implement `size_hint()` on all iterators and do so truthfully.

## Prefer types over generics, generics over dyn traits (M-DI-HIERARCHY) { #M-DI-HIERARCHY }

<why>composable patterns and freedom from design lock-in.</why>

When asking for async dependencies, prefer concrete types over generics, and generics over `dyn Trait`.

It is easy to accidentally deviate from this pattern when porting code from languages like C# that heavily rely on interfaces.
Consider you are porting a service called `Database` from C# to Rust and, inspired by the original `IDatabase` interface, you naively translate it into:

```rust,ignore
trait Database {
    async fn update_config(&self, file: PathBuf);
    async fn store_object(&self, id: Id, obj: Object);
    async fn load_object(&self, id: Id) -> Object;
}

impl Database for MyDatabase { ... }

// Intended to be used like this:
async fn start_service(b: Rc<dyn Database>) { ... }
```

Apart from not feeling idiomatic, this approach precludes other Rust constructs that conflict with object safety,
can cause issues with asynchronous code, and exposes wrappers (compare [M-AVOID-WRAPPERS]).

Instead, when more than one implementation is needed, this _design escalation ladder_ should be followed:

If the other implementation is only concerned with providing a _sans-io_ implementation for testing, implement your type as an
enum, following [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS] instead.

If users are expected to provide custom implementations, you should introduce one or more traits, and implement them for your own types
_on top_ of your inherent functions. Each trait should be relatively narrow, e.g., `StoreObject`, `LoadObject`. If eventually a single
trait is needed it should be made a subtrait, e.g., `trait DataAccess: StoreObject + LoadObject {}`.

Code working with these traits should ideally accept them as generic type parameters as long as their use does not contribute to significant nesting
(compare [M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS]).

```rust,ignore
// Good, generic does not have infectious impact, uses only most specific trait
async fn read_database(x: impl LoadObject) { ... }

// Acceptable, unless further nesting makes this excessive.
struct MyService<T: DataAccess> {
    db: T,
}
```

Once generics become a nesting problem, `dyn Trait` can be considered. Even in this case, visible wrapping should be avoided, and custom wrappers should be preferred.

```rust
# use std::sync::Arc;
# trait DataAccess {
#     fn foo(&self);
# }
// This allows you to expand or change `DynamicDataAccess` later. You can also
// implement `DataAccess` for `DynamicDataAccess` if needed, and use it with
// regular generic functions.
struct DynamicDataAccess(Arc<dyn DataAccess>);

impl DynamicDataAccess {
    fn new<T: DataAccess + 'static>(db: T) -> Self {
        Self(Arc::new(db))
    }
}

struct MyService {
    db: DynamicDataAccess,
}
```

The generic wrapper can also be combined with the enum approach from [M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS]:

```rust,ignore
enum DataAccess {
    MyDatabase(MyDatabase),
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl),
    Dynamic(DynamicDataAccess)
}

async fn read_database(x: &DataAccess) { ... }
```

[M-AVOID-WRAPPERS]: #M-AVOID-WRAPPERS
[M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS]: ../rust-testing/reference.md#M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS
[M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS]: #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS

## Essential functionality should be inherent (M-ESSENTIAL-FN-INHERENT) { #M-ESSENTIAL-FN-INHERENT }

<why>easily discoverable essential functionality.</why>

Types should implement core functionality inherently. Trait implementations should forward to inherent functions, and not replace them. Instead of this

```rust
# trait Download {
#     fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>);
# }
struct HttpClient {}

// Offloading essential functionality into traits means users
// will have to figure out what other traits to `use` to
// actually use this type.
impl Download for HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        // ... logic to download a file
    }
}
```

do this:

```rust
# trait Download {
#     fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>);
# }
struct HttpClient {}

impl HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        // ... logic to download a file
    }
}

// Forward calls to inherent impls. `HttpClient` can be used
impl Download for HttpClient {
    fn download_file(&self, url: impl AsRef<str>) {
        Self::download_file(self, url)
    }
}
```

## Complex type construction has builders (M-INIT-BUILDER) { #M-INIT-BUILDER }

<why>future-proof type construction in complex scenarios.</why>

Types that could support 4 or more arbitrary initialization permutations should provide builders. In other words, types with up to
2 optional initialization parameters can be constructed via inherent methods:

```rust
# struct A;
# struct B;
struct Foo;

// Supports 2 optional construction parameters, inherent methods ok.
impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_a(a: A) -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_b(b: B) -> Self { Self }
    pub fn with_a_b(a: A, b: B) -> Self { Self }
}
```

Beyond that, types should provide a builder:

```rust, ignore
# struct A;
# struct B;
# struct C;
# struct Foo;
# struct FooBuilder;
impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn builder() -> FooBuilder { ... }
}

impl FooBuilder {
    pub fn a(mut self, a: A) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn b(mut self, b: B) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn c(mut self, c: C) -> Self { ... }
    pub fn build(self) -> Foo { ... }
}

```

The proper name for a builder that builds `Foo` is `FooBuilder`. Its methods must be chainable, with the final method called
`.build()`. The buildable struct must have a shortcut `Foo::builder()`, while the builder itself should _not_ have a public
`FooBuilder::new()`. Builder methods that set a value `x` are called `x()`, not `set_x()` or similar.

### Builders and Required Parameters

Required parameters should be passed when creating the builder, not as setter methods. For builders with multiple required
parameters, encapsulate them into a parameters struct and use the `deps: impl Into<Deps>` pattern to provide flexibility:

> **Note:** A dedicated deps struct is not required if the builder has no required parameters or only a single simple parameter. However,
> for backward compatibility and API evolution, it's preferable to use a dedicated struct for deps even in simple cases, as it makes it
> easier to add new required parameters in the future without breaking existing code.

```rust, ignore
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FooDeps {
    pub logger: Logger,
    pub config: Config,
}

impl From<(Logger, Config)> for FooDeps { ... }
impl From<Logger> for FooDeps { ... } // In case we could use default Config instance

impl Foo {
    pub fn builder(deps: impl Into<FooDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }
}
```

This pattern allows for convenient usage:

- `Foo::builder(logger)` - when only the logger is needed
- `Foo::builder((logger, config))` - when both parameters are needed
- `Foo::builder(FooDeps { logger, config })` - explicit struct construction

Alternatively, you can use [`fundle`](https://docs.rs/fundle) to simplify the creation of `FooDeps`:

```rust, ignore
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[fundle::deps]
pub struct FooDeps {
    pub logger: Logger,
    pub config: Config,
}
```

This pattern enables "dependency injection", see [these docs](https://docs.rs/fundle/latest/fundle/attr.deps.html) for more details.

### Runtime-Specific Builders

For types that are runtime-specific or require runtime-specific configuration, provide dedicated builder creation methods that accept the appropriate runtime parameters:

```rust, ignore
#[cfg(feature="smol")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SmolDeps {
    pub clock: Clock,
    pub io_context: Context,
}

#[cfg(feature="tokio")]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct TokioDeps {
    pub clock: Clock,
}

impl Foo {
    #[cfg(feature="smol")]
    pub fn builder_smol(deps: impl Into<SmolDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }

    #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
    pub fn builder_tokio(deps: impl Into<TokioDeps>) -> FooBuilder { ... }
}
```

This approach ensures type safety at compile time and makes the runtime dependency explicit in the API surface. The resulting
builder methods follow the pattern `builder_{runtime}(deps)` where `{runtime}` indicates the specific runtime or execution environment.

## Complex type initialization hierarchies are cascaded (M-INIT-CASCADED) { #M-INIT-CASCADED }

<why>construction free of parameter mix-ups.</why>

Types that require 4+ parameters should cascade their initialization via helper types.

```rust, ignore
# struct Deposit;
impl Deposit {
    // Easy to confuse parameters and signature generally unwieldy.
    pub fn new(bank_name: &str, customer_name: &str, currency_name: &str, currency_amount: u64) -> Self { }
}
```

Instead of providing a long parameter list, parameters should be grouped semantically. When applying this guideline,
also check if [C-NEWTYPE] is applicable:

```rust, ignore
# struct Deposit;
# struct Account;
# struct Currency
impl Deposit {
    // Better, signature cleaner
    pub fn new(account: Account, amount: Currency) -> Self { }
}

impl Account {
    pub fn new_ok(bank: &str, customer: &str) -> Self { }
    pub fn new_even_better(bank: Bank, customer: Customer) -> Self { }
}
```

## Parameter ordering is consistent (M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY) { #M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY }

<why>low development friction.</why>

When the same conceptual parameters appear in multiple functions (within a crate or across crates in the same ecosystem), they should appear in the same order everywhere:

- important or call-specific parameters should generally go first,
- ubiquitous parameters rather go last (e.g., `&logger`),
- closures always go last (functions should not accept more than one closure).

```rust,ignore
// Bad, the order of `user_id` and `tenant_id` flips between functions, and
// the logger sometimes appears first, sometimes last.
fn create_user(logger: &Logger, user_id: UserId, tenant_id: TenantId) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, tenant_id: TenantId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }

// Good, call-specific parameters first in a consistent order, ubiquitous
// `logger` always last.
fn create_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
```

## Abstractions don't visibly nest (M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS) { #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS }

<why>low cognitive load and a good out-of-the-box UX.</why>

When designing your public types and primary API surface, avoid exposing nested or complex parametrized types to your users.

While powerful, type parameters introduce a cognitive load, even more so if the involved traits are crate-specific. Type parameters
become infectious to user code holding on to these types in their fields, often come with complex trait hierarchies on their own, and
might cause confusing error messages.

From the perspective of a user authoring `Foo`, where the other structs come from your crate:

```rust,ignore
struct Foo {
    service: Service // Great
    service: Service<Backend> // Acceptable
    service: Service<Backend<Store>> // Bad

    list: List<Rc<u32>> // Great, `List<T>` is simple container,
                        // other types user provided.

    matrix: Matrix4x4 // Great
    matrix: Matrix4x4<f32> // Still ok
    matrix: Matrix<f32, Const<4>, Const<4>, ArrayStorage<f32, 4, 4>> // ?!?
}
```

_Visible_ type parameters should be avoided in _service-like_ types (i.e., types mainly instantiated once per thread / application that are often passed
as dependencies), in particular if the nestee originates from the same crate as the service.

Containers, smart-pointers and similar data structures obviously must expose a type parameter, e.g., `List<T>` above. Even then, care should
be taken to limit the number and nesting of parameters.

To decide whether type parameter nesting should be avoided, consider these factors:

- Will the type be **named** by your users?
  - Service-level types are always expected to be named (e.g., `Library<T>`),
  - Utility types, such as the many [`std::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/index.html) types like `Chain`, `Cloned`, `Cycle`, are not
    expected to be named.
- Does the type primarily compose with non-user types?
- Do the used type parameters have complex bounds?
- Do the used type parameters affect inference in other types or functions?

The more of these factors apply, the bigger the cognitive burden.

As a rule of thumb, primary service API types should not nest _on their own volition_, and if they do, only 1 level deep. In other words, these
APIs should not require users having to deal with an `Foo<Bar<FooBar>>`. However, if `Foo<T>` users want to bring their own `A<B<C>>` as `T` they
should be free to do so.
